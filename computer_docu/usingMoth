Ubuntu Gnome - 

to log in (mocvd) as usual (may need to hit enter a few times to get to 
	login screen

The desktop is 'clean' nothing on it and it can be a bit hard to figure 
out at first (how to get anything going!

Mouse - left button is choose, 
		right button may show options if available in where you are
		middle scroll wheel can scroll in some places 
		middle scroll wheel is also 'paste' (say in terminal) 

	Move Mouse to Bottom of screen for a dock to appear to 
		choose application
			(sometimes there is a minor delay before it appears)
		
	
	Hit the (WINDOWS) key (left bottom of keyboard)
		and start typing first letters of command such as
			matlab
			terminal
			thunar (file manager - its icon is thor's hammer)
			screencapture
			geany (nicer editor for the matlab files)
			grsync
			
	Hit the (WINDOWS) key also will fly above and show all the windows
		(kind of like the Mac's  key on top of its keyboard)
		choose window/application to bring up on top by clicking
	
	Hit the (WINDOWS) key and other workspaces show up on right
		(you can move open applications between windows by clicking
			and draging while in the 'fly above' mode
		If you put something in every workspace, another workspace will
			be added (number of workspaces is dynamic)
	
	Hit the (WINDOWS) key and on left hand side menu is a 3x3square
		which will open up listing of all applications
		(as will also the applications menu on the bottom dock that
		you can get to by moving mouse to bottom of screen.


p.s. /home/mocvd/DATA/2016/2016_10_mocvd_nitride_XPCS/documentation/
holds things like the spreadsheet for filter corrections and other things
that might be useful.

If you have to remount the remote drives  - I find the easiest way is 
to open a file manager and in the 'location' do
sftp://det@alps   (it will then ask for password and then it is
mounted and available for the grsync guis to use
sftp://mocvd@fly  (for the spec data_
(I don't have the location of the Pixirad yet)
