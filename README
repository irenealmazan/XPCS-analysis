To plot area file stuff
datainput_AREA('sput_dec0617a')
(or look in this file to edit and make your own files for particular sample

Look in datainput_AREA has some options that are easy to change
but that I took out of the user file 'sput_dec0617a' so that
it was 'cleaner' to look at.


to plot spec file stuff (p_point, etc, just as line plots, run as

datainput_run('sput_dec0617a')
